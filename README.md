# AI Sports Predict
This is a web application used for predicting sports outcomes. In this initial version, the user can enter the NBA player, the point spread (ex: 25.5), and the matchup (ex: MIN @ LAL). After that is inputted, it uses a Random Forest Regression machine learning model to predict if you should predict over or under that amount. I use the nba_api to get the statistics for the current season, a sqlLite database to hold the statistics, and a flask backend implement the machine learning model and access the database. My plan is to continue to branch off into other statistical categories other than points. Then move into team predictions. And then move into other sports to create a full sports prediction website.
